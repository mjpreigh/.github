# Week 4 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Our plan is to have the frontend group finish implementing the calendar view and the backend group finish the creation of the database and queries as soon as possible. Then, we can continue building the auto scheduling algorithm with the plan to finish it at about 70%.
2. We mostly worked on the Architecture and Design assignment. We also created an empty Ruby on Rail project as well as an empty React Native project. The interface and calendar view mockups are also accomplished. The database schema is also finalized. We learned that we are a little behind without schedule, but we have a clear expectation and layout of what to accomplish next.
3. Our plan is to have the backend group finish the creation of the database and queries. The frontend group will start building calendar layout and implementing http requests to retrieve the calendar data through the REST API.

## Contributions of individual team members

#### Cat:
1. I will start to figure out how the React Native framework works and collaborate with Jacob to work on the calendar view with the goal to finish it early in order to get started on the auto scheduling algorithm.
2. I worked with other team members to finish the Architecture and Design assignment as well as finalized our data schema. I have a clear expectation of the project's architecture and design constraints, and I have not encountered any troubles.
3. My plan is to work with Jacob to build the calendar layout and implementing the http requests in order to retrieve the calendar data through the REST API.

#### Marlena:
1. In the coming week I will work on the completion of the database, and we are scheduled to design the auto-scheduling algorithm as well.
2. This week I worked with the team to complete our Architecture and Design plan. We now have a much more defined design of how our
data will look.
3. Next week I will work with the backend team on completion of database queries, and I will also work on the testing and CI assignment.
